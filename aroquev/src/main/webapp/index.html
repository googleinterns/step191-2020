    <h1>Armando Roque's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi and welcome to my personal portfolio! I am Armando, and here you will find interesting things about me (thanks
      for being interested!). I am currently studying Computer Science
      at Tec de Monterrey. During the Summer of 2020 I will be working as a Google intern in the STEP program (this is
      where this project was born), really exciting stuff!</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>I was born in Monterrey and have lived there ever since. Currently I am <span
          id="armando-age-container"></span> years old. I live with my partents and my brother Gabriel, who is also into
        Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I attended elementary and junior high school at Regio Contry, a Lasallian school where I spent 9 years (it is
        amazing to realize how much time I spent in those classrooms). After that I attended Prepa Tec Eugenio Garza
        Laguera High School, where I had so much fun and met many of my best friends. I also learned a lot, and I had
        the opportunity to take IB classes (Math, Business Management and Computer Science). After that I was admitted
        to Tec de Monterrey, and I've studying Computer Science there since 2018.</p>
      <h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
      <p>I was interested in technology since I was young, since my father has always been a computer enthusiast, so I
        had the chance to play with electronic gadgets as I was growing up. I was formally introduced to Computer
        Science in high school, where I worked with Java. After that, I figured out that I could continue learning about
        this interesting field of study and decided to major in it. The topics I am currently interested in are
        <b>machine learning, blockchain, computer vision and complexity theory</b>.</p>

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Just some stuff I enjoy doing in my spare time.</p>

      <h3>Marching band</h3>
      <p>I currently play the snare drum at my college's marching band, and I can also play the cymbals. It is really
        fun playing with the band and we get really excited when we get the chance to play at our local team's games and
        at Pep Rallys at our local theatre.</p>
      <p>Check out this video we made while staying at home during the spring of 2020!</p>

      <h3>Cycling</h3>
      <p>I enjoy hitting the trail with my mountain bike! It is really cool being able to excercise surrounded by nature
        and expore new routes. By the way, I am currently also trying to get into road cycling.</p>
      <p>Here are some pictures we have taken during our routes.</p>

      <h3>Soccer</h3>
      <p>I am a huge fan of soccer, and I enjoy watching and playing the sport (even on videogames!). I have always
        supported the local team Rayados, and thanks to my uncle I now also support
        German team Borussia Dortmund. Sometimes I think I could have been a professional soccer player!
      </p>
      <p>Here is a photo of my friend Chava and me at Rayados' stadium.</p>

      <h3>Traveling</h3>
      <p>I find it very interesting to be able to discover and interact with different cultures and all their historical treasures.</p>
      <p>I built this small map guide containing a few places you should visit when you come to Mexico!</p>
